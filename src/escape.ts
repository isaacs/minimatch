/**
 * Escape all magic characters in a glob pattern.
 *
 * If the {@link MinimatchOptions.windowsPathsNoEscape}
 * option is used, then characters are escaped by wrapping in `[]`, because
 * a magic character wrapped in a character class can only be satisfied by
 * that exact character.  In this mode, `\` is _not_ escaped, because it is
 * not interpreted as a magic character, but instead as a path separator.
 *
 * If the {@link MinimatchOptions.magicalBraces} option is used,
 * then braces (`{` and `}`) will be escaped.
 *
 * A leading `#` or `!` is escaped as well, so that the result is never a
 * comment or a negated pattern. In `windowsPathsNoEscape` mode, a leading
 * `!` is written as `@(!)`, because `[!` starts a negated class.
